# Optimize Database Query Performance

## Description
The customer dashboard is experiencing slow load times, particularly for users with large datasets. Performance metrics show that certain database queries are taking over 10 seconds to complete, which is unacceptable for user experience.

## Tasks
- Profile slow queries using database performance tools.
- Add appropriate indexes to frequently queried columns.
- Implement query result caching.
- Consider pagination for large result sets.
